# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for converting the existing web-based Python application "Whisper Transcription Tool v0.9.5.1" into a native macOS Desktop application "WhisperLocalMacOs". The application will maintain all core transcription functionality while providing a native macOS user experience with embedded dependencies and improved performance on Apple Silicon.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Transcription Functionality

**User Story:** As a macOS user, I want to transcribe audio and video files using a native desktop application, so that I can process media files without needing a web browser or external dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user drags an audio file (.mp3, .wav, .m4a, .flac) into the application THEN the system SHALL initiate transcription using the selected Whisper model
2. WHEN a user drags a video file (.mp4, .mov, .avi) into the application THEN the system SHALL extract audio using embedded FFmpeg and transcribe the result
3. WHEN transcription is in progress THEN the system SHALL display real-time progress updates with percentage completion and estimated time remaining
4. WHEN transcription completes successfully THEN the system SHALL generate output files in the user's chosen formats (TXT, SRT, VTT)
5. IF transcription fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message with suggested solutions

### Requirement 2: Batch Processing

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to process multiple audio/video files simultaneously, so that I can efficiently transcribe large volumes of content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects multiple files or drags a folder THEN the system SHALL add all supported files to a processing queue
2. WHEN batch processing is active THEN the system SHALL display a queue view showing file status (pending, processing, completed, failed)
3. WHEN processing multiple files THEN the system SHALL process files sequentially to manage system resources
4. WHEN a file in the batch fails THEN the system SHALL continue processing remaining files and report failures at completion
5. WHEN batch processing completes THEN the system SHALL display a summary showing successful and failed transcriptions

### Requirement 3: Model Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to download and manage different Whisper models within the application, so that I can choose the optimal balance between speed and accuracy for my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application launches for the first time THEN the system SHALL prompt to download the default tiny model if no models are present
2. WHEN a user opens the Model Manager THEN the system SHALL display available models with download status, size, and performance characteristics
3. WHEN a user initiates model download THEN the system SHALL show download progress and verify model integrity upon completion
4. WHEN a user selects a different model THEN the system SHALL use that model for subsequent transcriptions
5. IF a selected model is missing or corrupted THEN the system SHALL fallback to the default model and notify the user

### Requirement 4: Native macOS Integration

**User Story:** As a macOS user, I want the application to feel native to the operating system, so that it integrates seamlessly with my workflow and follows familiar interface patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application launches THEN the system SHALL display a native macOS window with toolbar, sidebar, and main content area
2. WHEN a user drags files from Finder THEN the system SHALL accept the drop and highlight the drop zone
3. WHEN the application is in the background THEN the system SHALL show transcription progress in the Dock icon
4. WHEN transcription completes THEN the system SHALL send a native macOS notification
5. WHEN a user right-clicks on output files THEN the system SHALL provide Quick Look preview support

### Requirement 5: Embedded Dependencies

**User Story:** As an end user, I want the application to work immediately after installation without requiring additional software, so that I can start transcribing files without technical setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is installed THEN the system SHALL include Python 3.11+ runtime, Whisper.cpp binaries, and FFmpeg within the app bundle
2. WHEN the application launches THEN the system SHALL verify all embedded dependencies are functional
3. WHEN processing files THEN the system SHALL use only embedded dependencies without requiring system-installed versions
4. WHEN the app bundle is moved THEN the system SHALL continue to function normally with all embedded dependencies
5. IF any embedded dependency is corrupted THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message and suggest reinstallation

### Requirement 6: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user with Apple Silicon hardware, I want transcription to be as fast as possible, so that I can process files efficiently and take advantage of my hardware capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running on Apple Silicon THEN the system SHALL utilize Metal Performance Shaders for accelerated processing
2. WHEN transcribing with the tiny model THEN the system SHALL achieve 2-3x real-time processing speed
3. WHEN the application launches THEN the system SHALL start up in less than 5 seconds
4. WHEN processing large files THEN the system SHALL monitor memory usage and warn if approaching system limits
5. WHEN multiple operations are queued THEN the system SHALL manage resources to prevent system slowdown

### Requirement 7: Output Format Management

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to choose from multiple output formats, so that I can use transcriptions in different applications and workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transcription completes THEN the system SHALL generate plain text (.txt) format by default
2. WHEN a user selects subtitle formats THEN the system SHALL generate SRT and/or VTT files with proper timing
3. WHEN output files are created THEN the system SHALL preserve original filename with appropriate extensions
4. WHEN duplicate filenames exist THEN the system SHALL append timestamps to prevent overwrites
5. WHEN output is generated THEN the system SHALL provide direct links to open files or reveal in Finder

### Requirement 8: Error Handling and Logging

**User Story:** As a user experiencing issues, I want clear error messages and access to detailed logs, so that I can troubleshoot problems or report bugs effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages with suggested solutions
2. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL maintain detailed logs of all operations
3. WHEN a user needs to report a bug THEN the system SHALL provide an in-app log viewer with export functionality
4. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL prevent data loss and maintain application stability
5. WHEN the application crashes THEN the system SHALL offer to send crash reports on next launch

### Requirement 9: Chatbot Integration

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to search through my transcriptions using natural language queries, so that I can quickly find specific content across multiple files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transcriptions are completed THEN the system SHALL optionally index content for semantic search
2. WHEN a user opens the chatbot interface THEN the system SHALL provide a search interface for transcribed content
3. WHEN a user submits a query THEN the system SHALL return relevant excerpts with source file references
4. WHEN search results are displayed THEN the system SHALL highlight matching content and provide context
5. IF chatbot features are unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully disable the feature without affecting core functionality

### Requirement 10: Distribution and Updates

**User Story:** As a user, I want to easily install and update the application, so that I can access new features and bug fixes without technical complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is distributed THEN the system SHALL be packaged as a standard macOS .app bundle within a DMG
2. WHEN a user downloads the application THEN the system SHALL launch without Gatekeeper warnings using ad-hoc code signing
3. WHEN updates are available THEN the system SHALL notify users and provide download links to new versions
4. WHEN the application is installed THEN the system SHALL support both Apple Silicon and Intel Macs
5. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL require macOS 12 (Monterey) or later
